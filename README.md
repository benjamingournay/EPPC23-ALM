## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Lab 01 - Tenant setup

In this lab, you will login to the account you are going to use during the workshop and you will create developer environments. You will also setup a GitHub account and a codespace.

[Lab 01 - Tenant Setup](./lab-01/README.md)

## üì¶ Lab 02 - Work with solutions - Test

In lab 02, you will learn about how to work with solutions. You will learn how to import a solution and how to export and unpack a solution. Then, you will inspect the solution to see what the structure of the solution is. After that, you will learn how to do the export and unpack more easily by cloning a solution.

## üì¶ Lab 03 - Work with solutions with a team

Now that you experienced how to work with solutions by yourself, let's also look at how to work together on solutions. How do you co-author a solution together with other developers? How does this work with developer environments?

## üöÄ Lab 04 - Deploy the solution to test and production

You will learn how to deploy the solution that we created to a different environment using pipelines for Power Platform in lab 04. This will include the setup of pipelines for Power Platform, how to create a pipeline & how to deploy a pipeline using it.

[Lab 04 - Deploy the solution to test and production](./lab-04/README.md)

## ‚úÖ Lab 05 - Add an approval before deploying to production

You will learn how to setup an approval so that you can ask someone to approve a deployment to production.
